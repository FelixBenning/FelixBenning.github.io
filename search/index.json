[{"content":"How much does it cost to become Carbon Neutral? Is it feasible? Or is it too radical? I think that many people paint a grimmer picture than necessary. In fact I would go so far as to say we can solve climate change in our lunch break. Let me explain\u0026hellip;\nI already argued why certificates are the right tool to limit climate change. In this post I explained how certificates guarantee the cheapest transition. But we still do not know how much \u0026ldquo;cheapest\u0026rdquo; costs, right? True, but since we know certificates will result in the cheapest transition, any possible transition we can imagine will be more expensive.\nSo if we just calculate the cost of a transition and use certificates to actually achieve it, then we will basically be guaranteed costs below that hypothetical calculation.\nAn Upper Bound So lets think of a transition where we can calculate the cost. The more intelligent the transition, the cheaper it would be. But a more intelligent transition is probably also very complex and would take way too much effort for my lazy self. So I am not going to think of a clever way to transition to carbon neutrality. Instead I am going to assume the following:\n nobody changes their consumption behaviour no build-out of renewable energy (the same energy mix) all the CO2 emitted will be recaptured from the air  In a sense this is the dumbest strategy one could use. Virtually any other strategy would be cheaper. Renewable energy prices are already competitive with fossil fuels, so transitioning at least old factories is a no-brainer, capturing CO2 directly from the exhaust would be cheaper than capturing it from the air, etc.\nThere are lots of ways to make this cheaper. But all of these ways introduce complexity. And I don\u0026rsquo;t want complexity. I want a quick and dirty estimation.\nSo how can we estimate the cost of this? Well according to a study called A Process for Capturing CO2 from the Atmosphere by Keith et al. in 2018, costs might range from 94$ to 232$ per ton. So lets say 200$ for good measure. How much CO2 do we emit? According to the world bank Germany emitted less than 9 tons/year in 2016 with a downward trend. So that works out to be 1800$ per year and capita to recapture everything.\nLet us put that into perspective: In 2019 Germany\u0026rsquo;s GDP per capita was approximately 46k$. This means Germany would have to spend 4% of their GDP to become climate neutral if we do it in probably the dumbest, most expensive way imagineable.\nClimate Neutrality is Easy To put that into perspective, 4% of an 8 hour workday, is 20 minutes. Which happens to be shorter than our mandatory 30 minute lunch break. So there you have it, if we used the dumbest strategy ever and did not change a single thing about our energy generation, consumption behaviour, etc. we would only have to work 20 minutes longer and this would already work out.\nIn Q2 2020 the German GDP fell by more than 9% due to Coronavirus induced lockdowns. People claiming that Climate Change would be worse than the Coronavirus are kind of off the mark.\nI think it is a bad idea, to tell stories of impending doom and blow the amount of effort needed to avoid climate change out of proportions. If your message is that people need to stop using airplanes and sail across the atlantic instead, then you should not be suprised that people will push back against measures poised to reduce emissions to zero. You taught them to expect these measures to demand great sacrifice. They do not.\nThe pandemic has demonstrated that we can adapt extremely quickly to a new situation. The production of face masks spun up within months to meet global demand, we transitioned to remote work at breakneck speed. If we would set proper incentives (like a price on CO2), transitioning to carbon neutrality would feel like a breeze.\nThe ingenuity of people will probably make the drag these certificates have on the economy hardly discernable from the natural fluctuations of our GDP.\nSo please, please stop fear mongering and simply vote for certificates! Sure we can probably terraform earth back to its previous temperature by scrubbing CO2 from the air later, but this will be much more expensive than what we can have right now.\n","date":"2020-10-31","permalink":"https://felixbenning.github.io/blog/economics/econ_impact_of_carbon_neutrality/","tags":["two-cents","politics","climate-change"],"title":"The Economic Impact of Climate Neutrality"},{"content":"Education is one of those topics, which everyone has an opinion on, and reforms are proposed every other day. In Germany it is even worse, as education is state\u0026rsquo;s jurisdiction, so multiply the mess by 16. So, is this just another proposal which claims to be much better than any others proposed before?\nI would definitely have an opinion to offer. But writing down this opinion is fruitless if I can not substantiate my claims. And this is fundamentally the problem of every proposal. No one has any real evidence. Where would you even get it from? Sure, there are a couple of pilot projects from time to time, where volunteering schools try out a new education model. But even those are not very reliable. Why? Because they volunteered.\nYou see, often the difference between an awkward theatrical performance and a comedy is the confidence with which the actors sell it. And it is painfully obvious if a teacher heavy handedly tries to implements the latest innovation taught in the last seminar they attended. I remember the time when we suddenly had to draw a mind map as an introduction to the topic in every class. So if all pilot projects are conducted by volunteers (i.e. people who believe in the new method) you are going to get much better results than you will get in practice, when the unmotivated teacher next door has to implement them.\nSo one of the biggest problems in education is the lack of data. Additionally you can not make arbitrary experiments out of ethical concerns. You are playing with the future of the kids you are experimenting with after all.\nObtaining Data with Positive Side Effects In my school there was a hallway decorated with quotes. One of them was roughly\n a teacher helps you solve problems you wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have without them\n this harmless joke has a true and problematic core: The teacher is the one, who designs the examination and ultimately grades the students. This is problematic for multiple reasons:\n  a lot of students will try to sabotage lessons by distracting the teacher, since material not covered will not be part of the exam. From a top down view they are of course sabotaging themselves as they prevent themselves from learning. But people are generally not patient enough to look that far ahead. So their objectives are grades. And sabotage is a shortcut to better grades.\n  exams posed by teachers are not comparable. This is ultimately unfair to the students, as anyone looking at the grade will have no idea what that grade actually means. One example from my own experience:\nWe had to choose between Latin and french in 6th grade. Latin was the choice of anyone who didn\u0026rsquo;t really want to learn another language as it promised to be a little bit of history and less vocabulary. This of course meant that our Latin class was atrocious from a language standpoint. To keep grades in a unsuspicious range, exams were ultimately translations of texts we already translated in class, with tons of vocabulary provided in a table on the side.\nTo prevent people from simply memorizing the entire text, some sentences were dropped from the original text. But using the words provided and remembering the story from class, you could reliably puzzle together the translation without really knowing any Latin at all.\nSo now I have a \u0026ldquo;good\u0026rdquo; Latin grade. But does that mean I am actually good at it? Of course not.\n  bad teachers can simply cover up their subpar teaching skills with easier exams.\n  In the last two years of school, the relation between teacher and students greatly improved. Why? Well because we were preparing for the final examination. An examination which was provided from a central authority - well\u0026hellip; central to the state within Germany. Suddenly the teacher was the coach, helping you pass the exam instead of causing your problem. And this flipped the teacher/student relationship on its head.\nCentral Examinations There is no reason not to do central examinations. The cost of mailing around exams is negligible at this point. Simply randomly shuffling exams around the country\n improves the teacher student relationship makes grades more comparable provides data on the effectiveness of teachers and their teaching methods removes a ton of bias against/for students by virtue of anonymity dampens the tendency for grade inflation over time  The only valid concern I heard so far, was that central examinations remove the flexibility teachers have with the syllabus. Since there is value in teachers adapting the syllabus around children\u0026rsquo;s interest. And nothing would be more unfortunate than a teacher shooting down curious questions because they can not afford the distraction from the syllabus.\nBut there is a relatively simply fix for that: Provide a menu of exercises in the exams so that students can pick an area they are strong in/where the teacher focused their lessons on.\nA potential problem with that approach is, that students might always pick the same topic (e.g. always pick probability in mathematics and never learn the basics of algebra and analysis).\nPoints not Grades To avoid this problem you could fundamentally redesign exams. What if you did not have a maths exam, but a probability, analysis and algebra exam and you would only have to take each of them at some point (in no particular order)? Finishing school would then not mean finishing a particular year, but rather achieving a minimum score in all required exams. You could have a progression of increasingly difficult exams in one subject (probability I, probability II,\u0026hellip;) or you could be even more radical and have everyone write the same exam with a selection of exercises of various difficulty. Beginners would do the easier exercises at the beginning, while advanced students would do the more difficult exercises with more points.\nThere is an important side effect of this approach. You can compare a students performance to their past performance more easily as they would be retaking \u0026ldquo;the same\u0026rdquo; test. This has multiple benefits:\n  in general every retake will result in a new high score. While grades measure where you should be by now, scores on such a gradual test would reflect where you are. And it is much more motivating to achieve a new high score than to just \u0026ldquo;stay on the same grade\u0026rdquo; year over year.\nAs students will have to achieve a certain threshold to finish school, there is still pressure to reach certain milestones. And students will inevitably compare themselves to each other. But there is still a much bigger sense of progress, if your score increases every time you retake the test.\n(I would bet that this is one of the reasons why sports are more popular than other subjects)\n  Since there is a minimum threshold of points students need to achieve in order to finish school, they will accumulate roughly this number of points over time. So what if we take the current average cost of teacher salaries per student, divide this cost per student by the total number of points, and pay teachers per point gained of their students?\nAt this point the interest of the student and teacher are perfectly aligned. And aligned interest result in a much more productive collaboration.\n  Since we now decoupled the measurement of progress from the school system, it is possible to loosen the screws on the syllabus. Teachers are free to come up with novel ways to teach their students. As they have a financial stake in the outcome, they will tend to be a bit conservative with changes - which is a good thing, as children\u0026rsquo;s futures are at stake - but if they are sure about something, they can just do it.\nOf course there will be some issues at the start: Maybe gaining points is easier for beginners than for advanced students, causing a windfall for entry level teachers. Or vice versa. Another problem is, that short term point gain might not be conductive to long term learning.\nThis can be balanced out by schools. So instead of paying teachers directly, the schools would be payed the amount all of their teachers earned. Then the school could redistribute these earnings to the teachers. They could just pay every teacher the amount of points their students earned, but they can also introduce additional measures to balance out the highs and lows of point gains over time. Since the school has the macro view as their students stay with them for longer than a year, it will have an incentive to invent measures which cause teachers to prioritize long term learning over short term learning.\nIn total this will result in a rapid trial and error process, where unsuccessful strategies are quickly weeded out, ultimately resulting in much more effective education.\nAn Optimization Algorithm We have designed an optimization algorithm, which optimizes the amount of points gained by students over their time in the school system. It is quite important to note that schools will optimize for points and not \u0026ldquo;learning\u0026rdquo;. And while the points try to measure \u0026ldquo;learning\u0026rdquo; progress, as soon as a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure (Goodhart\u0026rsquo;s Law).\nFor this reason this measure needs to be a moving target. It needs to be constantly readjusted to actually measure learning instead of \u0026ldquo;something else\u0026rdquo; which might be an artifact of the current measurement.\nSo the measurement should be designed by stakeholders in the outcome. E.g. Universities might desire students to have certain skills when they enter. So they are good candidates to create such measures as they will constantly see the results from students entering their halls. If they notice some skills were neglected, they can adjust the tests such that they test for these skills, which will mean the next round of optimization will put a greater emphasis on these skills.\nCompanies could also top up funding for certain skills, making points in these categories worth more, causing schools to focus more attention on these skills.\nWhy Grades are Unavoidable Okay, so if we have Grades at all, this might be a good idea. But what if you have the opinion that Grades are detrimental to students in general? Did I not just make an opinionated suggestion contrary to what I stated I would do in the beginning?\nWell, if your school believes that Grades are bad, they can delay grading students up until the last year. Then students would take all tests at once and collect all the necessary points at once. This results in a windfall for the school at the end of a students time at school.\nThat is a bit risky to fly blind up until the end you say? Well, it is also risky to never asses a students capability and hoping everything will turn out fine. But if you are convinced that this will improve students performance, you can do it.\nOkay, but what if you wanted to have no grades at all? Well how do you expect universities to select their students or companies to select their employees? If the school isn\u0026rsquo;t doing the testing, then the universities/companies will have to do it themselves. And they will not be able to observe candidates for years. In other words, their judgement will likely be based on a single test. Great way to reduce the pressure\u0026hellip;\n","date":"2020-10-11","permalink":"https://felixbenning.github.io/blog/two-cents/better_education/","tags":["politics","two-cents"],"title":"A Better Education System"},{"content":"First of all: A tax and certificate system is equivalent to some degree. The main difference is that taxes set prices while certificates set quantities. But more on that later. And since taxes are easier to understand I will start with explaining them.\n1. Understanding Taxes Assume you tax every ton of CO2 with 100€. Then every measure to reduce CO2 is taken, which is cheaper than 100€ per ton of CO2 and no other measures. In other words. You guarantee that all measures are taken which are cheaper than a certain threshold.\nNow our goal is to limit emissions. So our target is a volume, not a price. So how do you reduce CO2 emissions to a certain volume? Well you could start out with some tax e.g. 50€ and see what the resulting volume is let’s say 100 Ft (Fantasy tons). And the goal is 20Ft. Then you increase the price to 70€. So now all measures are taken which are cheaper than 70€ not 50€. So the volume has to decrease. The question is just by how much? So let’s say it goes down to 50Ft. So you increase the price to 100€ and the volume goes down to 30Ft. So you increase the price again to 120€ and finally the volume of CO2 produced goes down to 20Ft. This seems like a very elaborate process. Is there maybe a shortcut?\n2. Understanding Certificates Instead of adjusting taxes, until the desired quantity is reached, you now instead decide to auction (tradeable) certificates. For an individual company it does not matter whether you pay a tax of 100€ per ton of CO2, or buy a certificate priced at 100€ for every ton of CO2. So what is the difference? Well you release certificates for 20Ft of CO2. During the auction, companies consider how expensive it would be for them to reduce CO2 emissions. So they would bid higher until the certificate price is higher than it costs them to simply reduce their CO2 emissions. So what can we say about the final price? Well we know it already from the tax-case! The price will be 120€. Why is that? Well, assume that the price is lower. For example 100€. Well, we know from the tax example, that people would want to buy 30Ft at 100€. But only 20Ft are auctioned. So people would bid higher. To summarize: all those tax adjustments would happen during the auction. Which is a lot quicker than any policy making process.\nComparison There is no difference for a company whether it has to buy certificates at a certain price, or pay taxes equal to this price. So certificates and taxes are equivalent in this sense. But CO2 certificates allow the state to set the volume, while taxes are good for setting the price.\nBut in both cases the end result will be optimal in this sense: The cheapest measures to reduce CO2 will be taken first. Because all measures below the price/tax will be taken and none above. And while there might be market failures which need to be addressed in some cases, no other policy comes close to this efficiency guarantee.\nSo one should choose certificates if one wants to achieve a certain volume, and one should choose taxes if one wants to achieve a certain price.\nWhat do we want to achieve? Our stated goal is, to limit global warming between 1.5° and 2°C. The IPCC released a summary for policy makers how much CO2 can be released to achieve this goal (what is the budget). So the total volume is given. What is left to do is to distribute this volume over countries and time.\nSee this interactive dashboard for possible scenarios.\n For comparison: the EU emission trading system covers about 45% of the market and sets a reduction rate of 2.2%. In no scenario is 2.2% sufficient. The reduction rate rather needs to be roughly 10%. No wonder certificates were not effective so far. We did not set ambitious targets. Why should we blame certificates for achieving what we asked them to?\n After selecting such a scenario one simply has to emit the certificates calculated by the parameters provided and the market will do the rest.\nSummary Certificates guarantee the most efficient (cheapest) transition to sustainable energy. They allow us to simply input our desired value and automatically set incentives for companies to achieve these values. In this sense climate change is incredibly easy to solve from an economic perspective. The only issue is political will.\nQ\u0026amp;A What happens if a company runs out of certificates? Q: Is is correct, if all certificates for one year are sold, a company without certificates is not allowed to sell their products? (if they do not have measures to set CO2-emissions to zero?).\nA: A company without certificates is a company which did not bid higher, which means the alternative was cheaper (reducing their CO2 emissions). So therefore that company would be able to reduce its emissions. But you can always buy and sell certificates to other companies if you find out later that you misjudged.\nWho needs to buy certificates? Q: How are the CO2-emissions are calculated? Does the bakery in my neighborhood need a certificate or only the big energy/oil companies?\nA: Ideally certificates would cover all CO2 emissions. But in order to avoid the bureaucracy you can do the following:\n Assume that fossil fuels will eventually be burned, and since the amount of carbon atoms in these fuels is known and determine the amount of CO2 released, you can sell the certificates together with the fuels at import time/extraction. Consumers who buy the fuel would not have to deal with certificates because the filling station already bought the certificates with the gas. And simply sells it to you under the assumption that you are going to burn the fuel. So only companies importing or extracting the fuel would actually have to deal with certificates. Caveat: If you are a power plant and use carbon capture, then you bought fuel with certificates, but since you captured the CO2, you did not actually release the CO2 as assumed at the beginning. So in this case (if you prove that you captured the CO2), you can resell the certificate. (In this sense it is quite similar to \u0026ldquo;pre-tax\u0026rdquo;) ","date":"2020-10-09","permalink":"https://felixbenning.github.io/blog/economics/why_certificates/","tags":["economics","climate-change"],"title":"Why Certificates are the Right Tool for Limiting CO2 Emission"},{"content":"a lot of people would protest. There are of course more than two colors. For example \u0026ldquo;red, green, blue\u0026rdquo; are already three. Okay so maybe the statement was an exaggeration. How about \u0026ldquo;only 5 colors\u0026rdquo; (Red, Yellow, Green, Blue, Violet)? Some people might start to agree with that statement. Other people might list a few more. At some point words for more colors will run out. Yet some people would still disagree with the statement: \u0026ldquo;there are only x colors\u0026rdquo;. Even though we only have a finite number of words for them.\nWhy? because colors are wavelengths on the electromagnetic spectrum, therefore an infinite number of colors exist. We do not have an infinite amount of words for colors though. So how can we talk about colors, if we do not even have words to describe most of them? We are a bit fuzzy about it. \u0026ldquo;Red\u0026rdquo; is not one particular wavelength but rather a range. But not a range with clearly defined edges. More of a \u0026ldquo;redness\u0026rdquo; distribution over the wavelength were wavelengths farther away from a \u0026ldquo;red\u0026rdquo; core are \u0026ldquo;less red\u0026rdquo; than wavelengths closer to this \u0026ldquo;ideal red\u0026rdquo;.\nSo are (words for) colors really a finite set of fuzzy intervals on the electromagnetic spectrum? No, we still have not captured the full complexity of the topic. As our eyes only have three light receptors, we can not actually see every wavelength. Instead we infer the correct wavelength from all three receptors. Which means we can cheat them with only three lights - computer monitors (This is not Yellow).\nOkay but now we captured all the complexity, right? No. Our brains also try to correct for lighting, which is how the internet debate in 2015 whether a dress was #whiteandgold or #blackandblue came to be (The dress).\nColor is subjective and objective At this point no one would argue that our usage of color names is really objective. There are so many tricks of the human perception in the chain that colors could very well be called subjective. Yet few would take someone seriously who calls their blue shirt green if no one else sees it that way. People with colors between blue and green might get away with defining their shirts color. But if their shirt looks \u0026ldquo;obviously blue\u0026rdquo; you will have a hard time convincing people to call it green.\nOur perception is similar enough, that we treat colors as something objective even though it arguably is not. I would go so far as to claim, that you would be disregarded as an unhelpful pedant if you called a mix of red/green which appears as yellow on a screen \u0026ldquo;red-green\u0026rdquo; instead of \u0026ldquo;yellow\u0026rdquo;. The real question is: is that a bad thing?\nMy answer would be that it depends on context. If you are not in the context of physics or light engineering, insisting on more objective description of color is probably anything but helpful. And our \u0026ldquo;subjective\u0026rdquo; take on \u0026ldquo;objective colors\u0026rdquo; works, as human perception is similar enough to be a good basis for communication.\nColors in the way we use them, are not meant to describe an objective reality but rather an experience. But in order to communicate our experience to someone else, we need to use words in the same way. So you can not simply redefine colors for yourself. Because at that point no one knows what is meant by those words anymore without a lengthy definition process beforehand. This is the reason we might be annoyed at people trying to redefine the color of their shirt. It makes the communication of our experience to someone else more cumbersome.\nApplying the analogy I would guess that this notion of \u0026ldquo;sure, it is not really objective, but it is pretty clear what is mean by that\u0026rdquo; is the reason why some people claim\n There are only two sexes. Sure XX and XY are not the only chromosome pairs that exist in the world, and sure we do not really care about the underlying chromosomes (wavelengths) but rather the appearance of people (perceived colors). But we still insist on this subjective/objective mess of only two sexes (a finite set of subjective but very objective colors) because that simplifies the communication of experiences. So we ridicule you for trying to redefine your apparent sex (apparent shirt color)\n And I sympathize with this notion to some degree. Although I want to stop before the the last sentence - I would rather change my vocabulary if someone insists, than to actively hurt someone\u0026rsquo;s feelings for no reason, even if I think it is a bit silly.\nAnd when it is not immediately obvious (a shirt between blue and green) the person would be asked to define the \u0026ldquo;correct\u0026rdquo; color (sex) anyway.\nThe Sex and Gender distinction  The distinction between sex and gender differentiates a person\u0026rsquo;s sex (the anatomy of an individual\u0026rsquo;s reproductive system, and secondary sex characteristics) from that person\u0026rsquo;s gender, which can refer to either social roles based on the sex of the person (gender role) or personal identification of one\u0026rsquo;s own gender based on an internal awareness (gender identity). - Wikipedia\n As we can see from this definition, the line between sex and gender is not between chromosomes and outward appearance, but between (chromosomes and outward appearance - sex) and (behavior and roles - gender).\nTrying to translate this back into our analogy, \u0026ldquo;colorgender\u0026rdquo; would be something like:\n cold, bland, work - grey warm, love, warning - red etc.  Now is there a need for the word \u0026ldquo;colorgender\u0026rdquo;? Well I don\u0026rsquo;t really have any uses for it. So I do not think that such a distinction between color and colorgender needs to exist. And since this word does in fact not exist, most people seem to agree with me. And I feel similarly about sex and gender. Especially since a list of genders is basically just a list of boxes to put people into. No wonder that people make up new boxes all the time!\nIn that sense genders only really help to reinforce these stereotypes/boxes. So I do not really see a good reason to make this distinction. Which is not made ex ante anyway:\n In ordinary speech, sex and gender are often used interchangeably. - Wikipedia\n And languages like German do not even have two different words to make the distinction.\nSpanning the arch to Pronouns The reason people are clashing so bad over pronouns is that they operate with a very different set of assumptions.\nIn one camp you have people using Gender and Sex interchangeably and using this \u0026ldquo;subjective/objective\u0026rdquo; binary classification. From this set of assumptions it seems quite obvious that there only need to be two pronouns - maybe a third, neutral one. From this perspective introducing new pronouns seems absolutely superfluous and only serves to complicate communication.\nIn the other camp you have people who make a Sex and Gender distinction, where Gender represents boxes of stereotypes. As pronouns are associated with genders, from this perspective the unwillingness to allow for more than two pronouns represents the unwillingness to let people out of theses boxes (gender roles).\nIn some sense it is quite ironic: \u0026ldquo;progressives\u0026rdquo; created boxes with the term \u0026ldquo;gender\u0026rdquo; (roles/identity) and blame \u0026ldquo;conservatives\u0026rdquo; for being intolerant due to their unwillingness to roll with new boxes (new genders) which are a way for people to escape their previously created boxes.\nIt is definitely up there in the list of unnecessary controversies.\n","date":"2020-10-07","permalink":"https://felixbenning.github.io/blog/two-cents/there-are-only-two-colors/","tags":["two-cents","politics"],"title":"There are only two colors"},{"content":" Communism is not a bad economic system. It is not an economic system.\n Every economic system is fundamentally an allocation algorithm. Somehow it must be decided what is produced, and who can use/consume that. An economic system is the “recipe” (algorithm) for making this decision. If you specify such an algorithm, you can make statements about the result.\nFor example, Capitalism:\n1. Start Sate: Everyone starts with whatever they \u0026quot;own\u0026quot; and is free to decide what do with it (including their time). 2. Everyone has the option to trade if both parties agree. Continue trading until no such trades exist anymore.  You can then show that under specific circumstances the result of this algorithm is pareto optimal.\n pareto optimal does not mean perfect in any sense. Just not \u0026ldquo;obviously sub-optimal\u0026rdquo;\n The problem with Communism is, that it is an under-specified algorithm. You only state that everyone owns everything. But the question who gets to use/consume these things at any time, and who should work on what thing is not specified. So this “planning” still has to be done somehow.\nAnd since there is no mechanism which would do this decentrally like in Capitalism, it usually ends up being a centrally planned economy. And that requires a planner. The issue here is, that a group of people will never agree on what is best to do for the group. Even if the entire group is completely altruistic. The reason for this is, that no-one knows how other people feel about certain things.\nExample Consider a post-scarcity society of Alice, Bob and Charlie. They have housing, food and all the basic necessities. Now they have to decide what to do with their time.\n Alice is very curious and wants to explore space. So she wants the group to build a spaceship. Bob likes to relax, so he wants the group to build a swimming pool. Charlie is philosophically minded and wants the group to discuss the meaning of life.  Then what should the group do? None of them is egoistical, Alice and bob would be happy to share the spaceship/pool with the group. The issue is that they simply do not want the same things. But if one of them would be the planner, then they would simply decide to do whatever they want to do and impose it on everyone else. You could of course vote on this issue,\n A voting as a mechanism to generate a public preference relation is deeply problematic (see Condorcet Paradox)\n but even if you manage to get a majority for something, it would still result in the majority imposing their will on a minority. Essentially forcing them to work on something they are not interested in.\nSo you might think, that everyone should just work on their own project. But this is a very capitalistic outlook on things already. Since you essentially say: Everyone owns their time and they can do whatever they want to do with it. If you then introduce different skill sets, then it might stop making sense, that people work on their own projects. And suddenly you would have to introduce some form of \u0026ldquo;exchange system\u0026rdquo;. So you would likely end up with the second part of capitalism as well.\nSummary Communism is not an economic system, because it does not specify how people should use resources. And this vacuum is usually filled with a planned economy which is inherently authoritarian to some degree, since the priority list of the planner will never coincide with the priority list of every individual. Therefore it imposes priorities on other people.\nIn some cases, this imposing of priorities might be acceptable. Most people would probably agree that enough food and housing for everyone should be top priority. So you can artificially move these things up the priority list (generated decentrally by the capitalism algorithm), by guaranteeing them with unemployment help or universal basic income.\nChina ultimately decided to use the \u0026ldquo;Capitalism Algorithm\u0026rdquo; for most of its economy, letting it deal with the details. But they then modify the result by heavily subsidizing certain sectors. Essentially planning certain things centrally, while leaving the details to the capitalism algorithm.\nTL;DR: Economists do not discuss Communism, because there is no system to discuss.\n","date":"2020-10-05","permalink":"https://felixbenning.github.io/blog/economics/communism/","tags":["economics","politics"],"title":"Why Communism is not discussed in Economics"},{"content":"Before we begin, I should note that certain things simply seem impossible.

But since the contrary is grammatically unwieldy, I will present my thoughts as such.\nWhat is?  I think, therefore I am - Descartes\n We can be sure that something exists which does the thinking. You might now argue that abstract things like language and mathematics exist. Since a version of them can be part of your consciousness, which exists. But beyond that nothing concrete needs to exist, as thought experiments like Brain in a vat or Boltzmann Brains prove (as they are not falsifiable you can not prove you are not one of those, so therefore you can not prove that anything concrete must exist).\nWe have thus proven that this question is unsolvable beyond yourself and abstract concepts which exist within your thoughts.\nWhy? 1. Analogy/Intuition building A lot of triple-A games started to include minigames. This could be a card or board game in a tavern for example. Why is that interesting to us? Well consider playing a chess minigame. When you beat a piece – why do you do it?\nThe naïve answer is: “To win the game”. But then someone might ask: But why do you want to win the game? At which point you could go one level up and argue that, as the player character in the tavern, you want to win the bet placed on the game. Or improve your skills such that you can win such a bet in the future. A follow up might be: “Fair enough, but why do you want to earn money?”. You might of course argue that you can use it in order to buy a certain item, which will help you in your campaign. But then you could still ask: “Why do you want to beat the campaign of this game?”. You might go another level up and argue, that you want to beat this campaign in order to talk with your friends about it in real life.\nContinuing to ask “why?” long enough, will eventually lead you to a point where you would have to answer the meaning of life/the purpose of all your actions in your life. At which point some people go one level up and say: “To please my god and get into heaven”. But if we take a step back, we should start to realize: Going one level up is not really solving the problem, it is really just avoiding it.\n2. Abstract Reasoning Any answer to a “why?” question, could again be questioned. Such a chain of reasoning is either\n an infinite chain goes in circles or ends at some point  In order to build some intuition for this: Consider someone \u0026ldquo;walks\u0026rdquo; in order \u0026ldquo;to walk 1km\u0026rdquo;. We have an action with a purpose. We could now easily expand this chain by supporting the action of “walking” with the reason: “to walk 0.5km” and support the action of “walking 0.5km” with the goal of “walking 0.75km”, etc. And immediately we get an infinite chain of reasoning. And since neither the infinite chain of reasoning nor the circular reasoning is really satisfying, you might want to ask for a meta-reason for the entire chain/circle. In our example this could be \u0026ldquo;to walk 1km\u0026rdquo;.\nBut then we run into the same problem with chains of meta-reasons. In the end, we will not get to a truly satisfying answer. Now the naïve answer: “To win the game” suddenly sounds much better. If we already know we can get nowhere with our questions, maybe we should not start asking them to begin with.\nBut if there is no reason to life,\nWhat do? The absence of goals allows us to choose our own. And if we are allowed to do so, we might as well choose them according to our preferences. This will be slightly different for everyone. You have a ton of Lego bricks. Do something cool with it!\nWhat is (second time)? As already argued, we cannot definitively answer this question. But since we now have to choose what we want to do as we reflected on our preferences, it might be helpful to have a model of the world around us so that we can predict the effects of our actions. Since that lets us evaluate them according to our preferences. Note that the evaluation of different actions changes with our model of the world, since it changes the predicted effect of our actions, which influences their evaluation according to our preferences.\n With very light assumptions on the preference relation (cf. Von Neumann-Morgenstern Utility Theorem) a utility function can be constructed. Once this utility function is obtained it is easy to see that we are in the setting of Reinforcement Learning (i.e. find the best policy/behaviour, which maximizes this utility function)\n No matter the preferences, it is beneficial if the model of the world has a lot of predictive power. Since that will result in valuations of actions closer to the “true” valuation, which would require perfect knowledge about how the world works. So how can we obtain a model with high predictive power?\nThis question seems similar to “What is?” on the surface. If we know what is, we can use this to predict what will be. The difference is that we can discard thought experiments like the Boltzmann Brain as not useful for predicting future events. Sure, it might be the case that you are such a Boltzmann Brain, but in that case, you will cease to exist in a few moments anyway and it does not matter what you do. And whether or not you are a brain in a vat in a simulated reality or “real” does not matter either, since we are not trying to definitively answer what truly is, but rather how our actions will influence what will be, and whether we like it. And then it does not matter whether the result is simulated or not.\nFor simplicity (and we will soon find out how important simplicity is) it might be useful to assume, that your senses do tell you something about the real world. Now that we justified why we can rely on our senses again; we have essentially justified the Scientific Method (hypothesize, predict, test/observe, repeat). Prediction from existing hypothesis is straightforward, so is testing these predictions.\n Further testing by generating predictions which can be tested vs using a well-tested hypothesis (theory) for predictions which interest you (for choosing actions according to your preferences) is known and studied as the exploration vs. exploitation trade-off in Reinforcement Learning\n What is not straightforward is generating hypotheses from observations. “What are good hypotheses?” or “what can we learn?” are the questions which Statistical Learning is concerned with. Highlights include the No Free Lunch Theorem, which motivate the intuitive preference of scientists for simple/elegant hypothesis.\n Remember that Mathematics exists so statistical learning\u0026rsquo;s theory can be relied on.\n While I recommend reading up on the “no free lunch theorem”, here is an intuitive explanation for the less mathematically inclined: If you do not assume, that physical laws are independent of space and time, they become exceedingly difficult to test. How can you confirm that some hypothesis is true, if the behaviour can change over time? It is quite hard to disprove a hypothesis which is allowed to change over time. Since that just means that it changed in such a way, that the results you got make sense again.\nThis problem is known as Overfitting and can intuitively understood with pictures like Figure 1 \u0026amp; 2.\n           Figure 1: by Chabacano - Own work, CC BY-SA 4.0, Link Figure 2: By Ghiles - Own work, CC BY-SA 4.0, Link    This simplicity requirement (which makes hypotheses robust), is the main problem with conspiracy theories. Sure they might explain the same observations, but they require a lot more “twists and turns” and are hard to test, since an observation which does not fit is simply incorporated with more twists and turns. This lack of falsifiability is the same reason, why God is a severe case of overfitting.\nThe number of twists and turns required to justify an omnipotent, benevolent god in a world with horrible disease is nauseating. And since it does not offer any measurable predictive power, the simpler hypothesis should be preferred.\nShould Where do morals come from in such a nihilistic worldview? Well for once most people prefer it, if a certain set of rules known as morals is adhered to. And since we do not justify preferences and simply take them as our reasonless foundation, there is not really anything we need to add to that.\nBut understanding where they come from might help us build a better model of the world, which is desirable as already justified. Adding together the ingredients from Game Theory (evolutionary stable equilibriums and the Folk Theorem) and our scientific evidence that we are in fact a product of evolution, it is immediately apparent that an unspoken contract of not killing each other, etc. is in fact an Evolutionary Stable Nash Equilibrium in a repeated game. So the hypothesis that morals are in fact a Folk Theorem-esque Equilibria (which are enforced by the players) requires no additional assumptions and is as such extremely simple.\nIt is also a justification why people, which do not have these equilibria baked into their preferences/feelings (psychopaths), would still benefit from adhering to these Morals. Since Equilibriums from Game Theory are also optimal for the individuum.\nA word of caution While evolution is an optimization algorithm, any intermediate step is generally not optimal. And even in the limit, the result might only be a local optimum. It is often remarkably close to optimal - which is why the entire field of Bionics exists. But there is no guarantee that this is the case.\nSimilarly, assuming our intuitive Morals/Empathy have to be optimal (i.e. Evolutionary Stable Equilibriums) would likely be wrong. But at the same time, it is probably closer to optimal than we think. And Game Theory is only starting to understand the complex settings required to generate such behaviour. So it is likely a good rule of thumb to assume that our intuitive morals are probably rational in some way.\nTrolley Problem Let us consider the trolley problem for example, which is often used to test the edges of a Moral System. In order to avoid overcomplicated sentences, and since Folk-Theorem-esque Equilibriums are really (unwritten) social contracts. I will refer to this moral system as a social contract with the understanding that there need not be a written contract.\nA lot of attention is brought to the detail, that people are reluctant to switch the lever, and are especially reluctant to throw someone over the bridge railing in order to stop the trolley. This is no surprise once we realize that actively causing a death is a greater breach of the social contract, than not preventing a death. This is due to the reason that the contract enables people to feel safe around other people but does not make any guarantee about natural causes. You could never feel save around other people if they might, at any time, throw you under the bus for the greater good. The stress level of everyone would go through the roof. At the same time everyone can and should be more attentive when they move into dangerous places like train tracks. If you would ask people the question whether they prefer to live in a world, where they can feel safe around other people but are a bit more likely to get killed if they put themselves into dangerous places, compared to the other way around, most would pick the first option. Which is why this is the social contract which is enforced.\nThat said some edge cases do not really have to be decided if they virtually never happen. Since, if the probability of them happening is really low, they will have a negligible impact on the expected utility no matter the behaviour/actions in that situation.\nWho is covered? A lot of moral systems are problematic due to the fact, that they make a distinction between humans, animals and other things. But where are the borders? In the evolutionary progression from other apes where does a human start to become a human and attain coverage of the other set of morals? If the set of morals is simply a nash equilibrium/social contract, then the question whether someone is covered by it is simply a question whether someone is intelligent enough to accept to the terms and conditions of this contract. In other words: Animals are not protected, because they cannot provide us the same guarantees in return. They are not part of the social contract and thus also cannot break it, which is why they are only tried in courts by nutcases.\nCorollary: Artificial Intelligence should get these rights as soon as it can agree to this social contract.\nMisc Subconsciousness I find the notion of a consciousness vs. subconsciousness (Libet Experiment), as if there were two people stuck in a brain and one would be you yourself and the other “someone else” which you battle for control of your body over, very strange. The “consciousness” is just the thoughts we “observe” but not in some way separate from the unconsciousness.\nI guess you can compare it to the log entries an algorithm provides for bug fixing. Some parts can also be run in “Debug mode” pushing it into consciousness, i.e. providing more diagnostic information, e.g. breathing. Debug mode is usually computationally expensive. And analyzing the logs is like doing the computation twice, so especially expensive. Therefore, doing something on autopilot is more efficient. But that does not mean that you somehow gave up control.\nEmotions vs Rationality Since we do not require our preferences to be justified by some reason, our preferences and thus overarching goals will be greatly influenced by our emotions. But in order to avoid stumbling over your own feet, it is useful to evaluate actions rationality, or consider rationally whether they will interfere with your other preferences down the road. In that sense rationality is a tool for modelling the world in order to achieve more desirable outcomes.\nFree Will I find the question whether we have free will strange. What do you even mean by free? There is no “other” entity in yourself which could enslave you. So in that sense, of course you are free!\nCreativity If you ask whether your thought process is deterministic on the other hand, completely determined by all inputs and repeatable, that is not really a question whether you are free. That is the question whether you can be truly creative and produce something new, or whether your actions are simply a function of all outside influences.\nThe answer to that is that even classical computer programs can be creative. So you certainly can be. How can classical computers be creative? Well, have a look at procedurally generated terrain. It works by combining randomness (sometimes given from outside as a seed), with some trimming algorithm for the output to make sense (look like a landscape).\nAnd if you try to observe yourself when you are creative, you will likely notice, that you do something similar. You start with something random and try to make something relatively sensible out of it. For example, finding a proof for a mathematical statement usually begins by randomly cycling through statements you have already proven, and consider for every instance, whether it might be applicable/useful (trimming).\nTL;DR Creativity = Randomness + Trimming\n","date":"2020-10-03","permalink":"https://felixbenning.github.io/blog/two-cents/concise_philosopy/","tags":["two-cents","philosophy"],"title":"Concise Philosophy"},{"content":"\u0026ldquo;It is only about pointers\u0026rdquo; Proponents of counting from 1 often think that this is about pointers and claim that it only makes sense for computer scientist as accessing an element from an array on hardware translates to addition to the pointer which means that the first element is at 0. They then like to argue that an index from 1 would make more sense in maths and \u0026ldquo;for counting\u0026rdquo;.\nI will try to explain why this is not the case.\nUse cases For that we first have to consider how indices are used and which parts might result in mistakes. And the following observation is quite important for that\n People rarely if ever want to have a particular element from a list. Almost all algorithms either iterate through through the entire list, access slices of the list or search for a particular element.\n So let us consider these use cases.\n  If you want to search for an element you never see the index anyway. You might say something like\nidx = my_list.index(my_element) # use idx in code  In that case you do not care whether the index starts from 0 or 1 as you never see the index anyway.\n  If you want to iterate through the list, you should not have to be concerned with indices either as modern languages all the in operator which yields all the elements of an iterable one by one.\nfor element in my_list: pass # do something with element    Slicing As you might guess from the header I consider slicing to be the only case where you actually have to think about indices. So let us think of some use cases.\n access the first n elements of a list access the last n elements of a list create n sized chunks (and a residual) get the column and row of a n x m matrix encoded as a vector of length nm  1. Accessing the first n elements So how could we get the first n elements in a 1 based vector? Well we would like\nl[1:n]  or\nl[:n]  and we can define it like this. But this also means that\nl[a:b] = [l[a], ...,l[b]]  and thus\nlen(l[a:b]) == b - a +1  and we will see that this becomes a sore thumb in our third task.\nSo what is the alternative? Half open intervals! Python\u0026rsquo;s 0 based indexing defines slices like this\nl[a:b] = [l[a],...,l[b-1]]  thus we get\n( len(l[a:b]) == b-a ) and ( len(l[:n]) == n )  2. Accessing the last n elements So how can we access the last n elements? Well let us first consider how to access the last element. If we use 1 based indexing with closed intervals it would be\nl[len(l)]  so you might get the last n elements with\nl[len(l)-n:]  Did you spot the bug? Remember len(l[a:b]) == b-a +1! So we actually have to write\nl[len(l)+1-n:]  So how does 0-based indexing do? Not only can you write\nl[len(l)-n:]  in 0 based indexing, you can be even more brief by realizing that\nif n \u0026lt; len(l): len(l) - n == (-n) % len(l)  in words: we can use modulo calculations to wrap around negative numbers. We could even allow arbitrary numbers to never be out of range with\nl[n % len(l)]  But out of bounds errors are sometimes quite helpful. So python only allows this for negative numbers larger than -len(l).\nIn particular you can access the last element with l[-1] and the last n elements with\nl[-n:]  Now you could do something similar in 1 based indexing, just that you do not have the beautiful modulo based (wrapping around) explanation as you skip zero. And you would end up with\nl[-len(l):]  resulting in an out of bounds error, while this is perfectly valid in python.\n3. create n sized chunks (and a residual) this is probably the most prevalent operations (e.g. converting vectors into matrices, splitting an array up into chunks for parallel processing, etc.)\nSo how does a 0 based algorithm look?\nslices = [ l[a:a+n] for a in range(len(l)/n) ] residual = l[-(n % len(l)):]  generates a list of n sized slices of l and the residual. So how would the same list comprehension look in 1 based indexing?\nslices = [ l[a:a+n-1] for a in range(len(l)/n) ] residual = l[ len(l) - (n % len(l)) +1:]  not only do you now have off-by one cases. In one case you have to subtract while you have to add if you count from the end. You are bound to mess that up on your first try if you do not carefully think about it.\n4. get the column and row of a n x m matrix encoded as a vector of length nm this is not even a battle, lets say we are row-major\n0 based:\ncolumn = idx / m row = idx % m  1 based:\ncolumn = (idx - 1) / m +1 row = (idx - 1) % m +1  let us take a victory lap and convert a (column, row) tuple back into an index\n0 based:\nidx = column * m + row  1 based:\nidx = (column -1) * m + row  Additional benefits of 0 based indexing It is often the case that you have some sort of \u0026ldquo;special\u0026rdquo; column. E.g. the \u0026ldquo;bias\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;intercept\u0026rdquo; in machine learning / statistics. In 0 based indexing, the 0th index naturally becomes this special column, and the n-th real attribute naturally maps to the index n.\nExceptions There are probably a few exceptions to the rule \u0026ldquo;you will never want to access a particular index\u0026rdquo;. While you will almost always iterate through the entire thing, I can think of at least one example where you might want to access a specific index. But it is also the only example I can think of. And since you only have to access a single index, the mental overhead for conversion is not as critical as when you have to deal with slices of (multidimensional) matrices.\nThis example I can think of is quantiles. If you want to access the median for example, you would first sort the list, and then obtain the index in the center. If \u0026ldquo;the center\u0026rdquo; exists. More generally, if you want to have the q-quantile. You would want to have the floor(len(l)/q)-th and ceil(len(l)/q)-th element and linearly combine them to obtain an approximation of the q-quantile.\nand if you use 0 based indexing you will have to shift the index down by one. Annoying but not quite as bad as the erratic plus/minus ones you have to deal with in 1 based indexing.\nSummary When accessing a particular index, 1 based indexing might make sense. But not only is that a relatively simple operations where you can deal with the additional mental overhead of an index shift. It is also a relatively rare operation.\nWhen it comes to slices, 0 based indexing with half open intervals is significantly easier to deal with than 1 based indexing with closed intervals. Arguably half open intervals are more important than 0 based indexing. Now you could of course do half open slices with 1 based indexing, but then you either have to accept that the first n elements are\nl[:n+1]  or you could have intervals which are open on the left side. In other words:\nl[a:b] = [l[a+1],...,l[b]]  note that this is equivalent to switching to 0 based indexing for slicing (with half open intervals on the right).\nDijkstra argues that it is really unintuitive to have a slice start with a lower number than the first index\nl[:n] = l[0:n] = [l[1],...,l[n]]  but I don\u0026rsquo;t think it is that much worse than half open intervals on the other side. It is definitely an improvement over closed intervals.\nBut what is a direct result of 0 based indexing, is that modulo calculus becomes significantly easier (see fourth example) and the residual in the third example. And I would say that the situations where you need to use modulo calculus on indices are not only more frequent than the situations where you need to access a particular index, but they are also more mentally taxing which means that you have less mental capacity to deal with index shenanigans.\nAnd from a practical perspective: writing programs as a student in R resulted in numerous off-by-one errors. Now I am mostly writing Python, and I can not recall the last time I had off-by-one issues.\n","date":"2020-10-03","permalink":"https://felixbenning.github.io/blog/programming/0_vs_1_based_indexing/","tags":["programming","maths"],"title":"Zero vs One-based Indexing"}]
