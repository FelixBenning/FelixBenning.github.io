You can not reason whether logic makes sense using logic. So I will not even
try. We will see shortly that I find some other things to be impossible.
Being trained in mathematics, I do not find that too unusual. While I think
that my belief system turned out to be remarkable consistent and did not
really encounter any problems in the last few years, I would be stupid to
think I have discovered an absolute truth. But since the contrary is
grammatically unwieldy, I will present my thoughts as such.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
