variable costs and increased the share of fixed costs. In support of this claim,
take a random sample of technologies, e.g. the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_technologies&amp;amp;oldid=984777058" target="_blank">list of practical
technologies on
wikipedia&lt;/a>:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>CO2 Budget Model</title><link>https://felixbenning.github.io/blog/economics/co2_budget_model/</link><pubDate>Sat, 31 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://felixbenning.github.io/blog/economics/co2_budget_model/</guid><description> This is a quick and dirty embedding of an older shiny app you can also access in full size</description></item><item><title>The Economic Impact of Climate Neutrality</title><link>https://felixbenning.github.io/blog/economics/econ_impact_of_carbon_neutrality/</link><pubDate>Sat, 31 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://felixbenning.github.io/blog/economics/econ_impact_of_carbon_neutrality/</guid><description>&lt;p>How much does it cost to become Carbon Neutral?

fact I would go so far as to say we can solve climate change in our lunch
