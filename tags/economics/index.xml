In some sense it defines what being alive means and I tend to view preferences as axioms. They are also treated as axioms in economics. But what are preferences?
Formally preferences are a binary relation on the set of possible world states. The greater or equal symbol &amp;ldquo;≥&amp;rdquo; is such a binary relation for example and a good intuition for what we are getting at. We then make certain assumptions about this relation:
First of all we assume connexity (also called &amp;ldquo;completeness&amp;rdquo;). This just means that we can compare any two world states, which means that for any two world states A and B, we either &amp;ldquo;weakly prefer A over B&amp;rdquo; (A ≿ B) or we &amp;ldquo;weakly prefer B over A&amp;rdquo; or both.</description></item><item><title>Categorizing Financial Instruments</title><link>https://www.unassuming.page/blog/economics/categorizing_financial_instruments/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.unassuming.page/blog/economics/categorizing_financial_instruments/</guid><description>&lt;p>This article is supposed to be a crash course in financial markets.

variable costs and increased the share of fixed costs. In support of this claim,
take a random sample of technologies, e.g. the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_technologies&amp;amp;oldid=984777058" target="_blank">list of practical
technologies on

Is it feasible? Or is it too
radical? I think that many people paint a grimmer picture than necessary. In
fact I would go so far as to say we can solve climate change in our lunch
break.

The
main difference is that taxes set prices while certificates set quantities.
But more on that later. And since taxes are easier to understand I will start
with explaining them.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Why Communism is not discussed in Economics</title><link>https://www.unassuming.page/blog/economics/communism/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.unassuming.page/blog/economics/communism/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Communism is not a bad economic system. It is not an economic system.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Every economic system is fundamentally an allocation algorithm. Somehow it
must be decided what is produced, and who can use/consume that. An economic
system is the “recipe” (algorithm) for making this decision. If you specify
such an algorithm, you can make statements about the result.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
