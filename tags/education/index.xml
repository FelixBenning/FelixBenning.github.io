In some sense it defines what being alive means and I tend to view preferences as axioms. They are also treated as axioms in economics. But what are preferences?
Formally preferences are a binary relation on the set of possible world states. The greater or equal symbol &amp;ldquo;≥&amp;rdquo; is such a binary relation for example and a good intuition for what we are getting at. We then make certain assumptions about this relation:
First of all we assume connexity (also called &amp;ldquo;completeness&amp;rdquo;). This just means that we can compare any two world states, which means that for any two world states A and B, we either &amp;ldquo;weakly prefer A over B&amp;rdquo; (A ≿ B) or we &amp;ldquo;weakly prefer B over A&amp;rdquo; or both.</description></item><item><title>Categorizing Financial Instruments</title><link>https://www.unassuming.page/blog/economics/categorizing_financial_instruments/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.unassuming.page/blog/economics/categorizing_financial_instruments/</guid><description>&lt;p>This article is supposed to be a crash course in financial markets.
