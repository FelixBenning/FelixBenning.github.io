choose from. And people regularly create new options since they are not happy
with the existing ones. But for version control, there exists essentially just
one option: &lt;code>Git&lt;/code>. And while it takes some getting used to, it must do something
right, if nobody wants to spend the effort to improve upon it. This is a
small introduction.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Intuitive Indexing</title><link>https://www.unassuming.page/blog/programming/intuitive-indexing/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.unassuming.page/blog/programming/intuitive-indexing/</guid><description>&lt;p>While most programming languages use 0-based indexing &lt;a href="https://hisham.hm/2021/01/18/again-on-0-based-vs-1-based-indexing/" target="_blank">some people are not
convinced&lt;/a> that this is a good thing and not just the legacy of
the language C. They argue that starting to index with one is more &lt;em>intuitive&lt;/em>
than starting to index with zero, and that there is no good reason to use
0-based indices besides pointer arithmetic which should not be of concern to
higher level programming.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And to be fair, proponents of zero based indexing have mostly failed to provide
a convincing argument for their preference (&lt;a href="#5-ranges">Dijkstra&amp;rsquo;s range
argument&lt;/a> aside). To remedy this, I am going to present 5 arguments
for 0-based indexing and address the intuition argument of 1-based
indexing.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
