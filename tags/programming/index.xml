&lt;p>Proponents of counting from 1 often think that this is about pointers and
claim that it only makes sense for computer scientist as accessing an element
from an array on hardware translates to addition to the pointer which means
that the first element is at 0. They then like to argue that an index from 1
would make more sense in maths and &amp;ldquo;for counting&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I will try to explain why this is not the case.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
