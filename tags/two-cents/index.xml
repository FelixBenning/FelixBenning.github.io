are proposed every other day. In Germany it is even worse, as education is state&amp;rsquo;s
jurisdiction, so multiply the mess by 16. So, is this just another
proposal which claims to be much better than any others proposed before?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>There are only two colors</title><link>https://felixbenning.github.io/blog/two-cents/there-are-only-two-colors/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://felixbenning.github.io/blog/two-cents/there-are-only-two-colors/</guid><description>&lt;p>a lot of people would protest. There are of course more than two colors. For
example &amp;ldquo;red, green, blue&amp;rdquo; are already three. Okay so maybe the statement was
an exaggeration. How about &amp;ldquo;only 5 colors&amp;rdquo; (Red, Yellow, Green, Blue,
Violet)? Some people might start to agree with that statement. Other people
might list a few more. At some point words for more colors will run out. Yet
some people would still disagree with the statement: &amp;ldquo;there are only x
colors&amp;rdquo;. Even though we only have a finite number of words for them.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Concise Philosophy</title><link>https://felixbenning.github.io/blog/two-cents/concise_philosopy/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://felixbenning.github.io/blog/two-cents/concise_philosopy/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="what-is">What is?&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>I think, therefore I am - &lt;em>Descartes&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>We can be sure that something exists which does the thinking. You might
now argue that abstract things like language and mathematics exist. Since a
version of them can be part of your consciousness, which exists. But beyond
that nothing concrete needs to exist, as thought experiments like &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_in_a_vat" target="_blank">Brain in a
vat&lt;/a> or &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann_brain" target="_blank">Boltzmann
Brains&lt;/a>
prove (as they are not falsifiable you can not prove you are &lt;em>not&lt;/em> one
of those, so therefore you can not prove that anything concrete &lt;em>must&lt;/em> exist).&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
