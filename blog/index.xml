developed countries), equal opportunity is still an open issue. In a free
market wages and hiring decisions are not up to the law and thus equal rights
are not enough to guarantee equal opportunity. While wages for equal work can
be achieved with transparency and public pressure, it is much more difficult to
quantify hiring discrimination. For this reason many people argue for a quota
to actually affect these decisions with written law, so that injustices could
be tried in court.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Economics 101</title><link>https://www.unassuming.page/blog/economics/economics_101/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.unassuming.page/blog/economics/economics_101/</guid><description>Utility Everyone has preferences. In some sense it defines what being alive means and I tend to view preferences as axioms. They are also treated as axioms in economics. But what are preferences?
Formally preferences are a binary relation on the set of possible world states. The greater or equal symbol &amp;ldquo;≥&amp;rdquo; is such a binary relation for example and a good intuition for what we are getting at. We then make certain assumptions about this relation:
First of all we assume connexity (also called &amp;ldquo;completeness&amp;rdquo;). This just means that we can compare any two world states, which means that for any two world states A and B, we either &amp;ldquo;weakly prefer A over B&amp;rdquo; (A ≿ B) or we &amp;ldquo;weakly prefer B over A&amp;rdquo; or both.</description></item><item><title>Categorizing Financial Instruments</title><link>https://www.unassuming.page/blog/economics/categorizing_financial_instruments/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.unassuming.page/blog/economics/categorizing_financial_instruments/</guid><description>&lt;p>This article is supposed to be a crash course in financial markets.

variable costs and increased the share of fixed costs. In support of this claim,
take a random sample of technologies, e.g. the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_technologies&amp;amp;oldid=984777058" target="_blank">list of practical
technologies on
wikipedia&lt;/a>:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A Recipe for Endless War</title><link>https://www.unassuming.page/blog/two-cents/recipe_for_endless_war/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.unassuming.page/blog/two-cents/recipe_for_endless_war/</guid><description>&lt;p>On sunday the game of the &amp;ldquo;Hooligan Eagles&amp;rdquo; against the &amp;ldquo;LesserEvil Hawks&amp;rdquo;
is taking place. The city decided, in order to protect the police, it
will not send in police to enforce a peaceful game. Instead, it intends to
supply the fans of the &amp;ldquo;LesserEvil Hawks&amp;rdquo; with handguns so they can protect
themselves against the often violent fans of the &amp;ldquo;Hooligan Eagles&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When the referee takes one of the Hooligan Eagles players off the field for a
foul, the camera pans to an increasingly rowdy crowd of Eagle fans close to
the Hawks fan section.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>CO2 Budget Model</title><link>https://www.unassuming.page/blog/economics/co2_budget_model/</link><pubDate>Sat, 31 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.unassuming.page/blog/economics/co2_budget_model/</guid><description> This is a quick and dirty embedding of an older shiny app you can also access in full size</description></item><item><title>The Economic Impact of Climate Neutrality</title><link>https://www.unassuming.page/blog/economics/econ_impact_of_carbon_neutrality/</link><pubDate>Sat, 31 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.unassuming.page/blog/economics/econ_impact_of_carbon_neutrality/</guid><description>&lt;p>How much does it cost to become Carbon Neutral?

are proposed every other day. In Germany it is even worse, as education is state&amp;rsquo;s
jurisdiction, so multiply the mess by 16. So, is this just another
proposal which claims to be much better than any others proposed before?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Why Certificates are the Right Tool for Limiting CO2 Emission</title><link>https://www.unassuming.page/blog/economics/why_certificates/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.unassuming.page/blog/economics/why_certificates/</guid><description>&lt;p>First of all: A tax and certificate system is equivalent to some degree. The
main difference is that taxes set prices while certificates set quantities.
But more on that later. And since taxes are easier to understand I will start
with explaining them.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>There are only two colors</title><link>https://www.unassuming.page/blog/two-cents/there-are-only-two-colors/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.unassuming.page/blog/two-cents/there-are-only-two-colors/</guid><description>&lt;p>a lot of people would protest. There are of course more than two colors. For
example &amp;ldquo;red, green, blue&amp;rdquo; are already three. Okay so maybe the statement was
an exaggeration. How about &amp;ldquo;only 5 colors&amp;rdquo; (Red, Yellow, Green, Blue,
Violet)? Some people might start to agree with that statement. Other people
might list a few more. At some point words for more colors will run out. Yet
some people would still disagree with the statement: &amp;ldquo;there are only x
colors&amp;rdquo;. Even though we only have a finite number of words for them.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Why Communism is not discussed in Economics</title><link>https://www.unassuming.page/blog/economics/communism/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.unassuming.page/blog/economics/communism/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Communism is not a bad economic system. It is not an economic system.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Every economic system is fundamentally an allocation algorithm. Somehow it
must be decided what is produced, and who can use/consume that. An economic
system is the “recipe” (algorithm) for making this decision. If you specify
such an algorithm, you can make statements about the result.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Concise Philosophy</title><link>https://www.unassuming.page/blog/two-cents/concise_philosophy/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.unassuming.page/blog/two-cents/concise_philosophy/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="what-is">What is?&lt;/h2>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I think, therefore I am - &lt;em>Descartes&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>We can be sure that something exists which does the thinking. You might
now argue that abstract things like language and mathematics exist. Since a
version of them can be part of your consciousness, which exists. But beyond
that nothing concrete needs to exist, as thought experiments like &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_in_a_vat" target="_blank">Brain in a
vat&lt;/a> or &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann_brain" target="_blank">Boltzmann
Brains&lt;/a>
prove (as they are not falsifiable you can not prove you are &lt;em>not&lt;/em> one
of those, so therefore you can not prove that anything concrete &lt;em>must&lt;/em> exist).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Intuitive Indexing</title><link>https://www.unassuming.page/blog/programming/intuitive-indexing/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.unassuming.page/blog/programming/intuitive-indexing/</guid><description>&lt;p>While most programming languages use 0-based indexing &lt;a href="https://hisham.hm/2021/01/18/again-on-0-based-vs-1-based-indexing/" target="_blank">some people are not
convinced&lt;/a> that this is a good thing and not just the legacy of
the language C. They argue that starting to index with one is more &lt;em>intuitive&lt;/em>
than starting to index with zero, and that there is no good reason to use
0-based indices besides pointer arithmetic which should not be of concern to
higher level programming.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And to be fair, proponents of zero based indexing have mostly failed to provide
a convincing argument for their preference (&lt;a href="#5-ranges">Dijkstra&amp;rsquo;s range
argument&lt;/a> aside). To remedy this, I am going to present 5 arguments
for 0-based indexing and address the intuition argument of 1-based
indexing.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
