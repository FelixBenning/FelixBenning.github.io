main difference is that taxes set prices while certificates set quantities.
But more on that later. And since taxes are easier to understand I will start
with explaining them.</p><h2 id=1-understanding-taxes>1. Understanding Taxes</h2><p>Assume you tax every ton of CO2 with 100€. Then every measure to reduce CO2
is taken, which is cheaper than 100€ per ton of CO2 and
no other measures. In other words. You guarantee that all measures are taken
which are cheaper than a certain threshold.</p><p>Now our goal is to limit emissions. So our target is a volume, not a price.
So how do you reduce CO2 emissions to a certain volume? Well you could start
out with some tax e.g. 50€ and see what the resulting volume is let’s say 100
Ft (Fantasy tons). And the goal is 20Ft. Then you increase the price to 70€.
So now all measures are taken which are cheaper than 70€ not 50€. So the
volume has to decrease. The question is just by how much? So let’s say it
goes down to 50Ft. So you increase the price to 100€ and the volume goes down
to 30Ft. So you increase the price again to 120€ and finally the volume of
CO2 produced goes down to 20Ft. This seems like a very elaborate process. Is
there maybe a shortcut?</p><h2 id=2-understanding-certificates>2. Understanding Certificates</h2><p>Instead of adjusting taxes, until the desired
quantity is reached, you now instead decide to auction (tradeable)
certificates. For an individual company it does not matter whether you pay a
tax of 100€ per ton of CO2, or buy a certificate priced at 100€ for every ton
of CO2. So what is the difference? Well you release certificates for 20Ft of
CO2. During the auction, companies consider how expensive it would be for
them to reduce CO2 emissions. So they would bid higher until the certificate
price is higher than it costs them to simply reduce their CO2 emissions. So
what can we say about the final price? Well we know it already from the
tax-case! The price will be 120€. Why is that? Well, assume that the price is
lower. For example 100€. Well, we know from the tax example, that people
would want to buy 30Ft at 100€. But only 20Ft are auctioned. So people would
bid higher. To summarize: all those tax adjustments would happen during the
auction. Which is a lot quicker than any policy making process.</p><h2 id=comparison>Comparison</h2><p>There is no difference for a company whether it has to buy
certificates at a certain price, or pay taxes equal to this price. So
certificates and taxes are equivalent in this sense. But CO2 certificates
allow the state to set the volume, while taxes are good for setting the
price.</p><p>But in both cases the end result will be optimal in this sense: The cheapest
measures to reduce CO2 will be taken first. Because all measures below the
price/tax will be taken and none above. And while there might be market
failures which need to be addressed in some cases, no other policy comes close
to this efficiency guarantee.</p><p>So one should choose certificates if one wants to achieve a certain volume, and
one should choose taxes if one wants to achieve a certain price.</p><h2 id=what-do-we-want-to-achieve>What do we want to achieve?</h2><p>Our stated goal is, to limit global warming between 1.5° and 2°C. The IPCC
released a <a href=https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/chapter/spm/spm-c/ target=_blank>summary for policy
makers</a> how much CO2 can be
released to achieve this goal (what is the budget). So the total volume is
given. What is left to do is to distribute this volume over countries and time.</p><p>See this <a href=https://felix-benning.shinyapps.io/emissionmodel/ target=_blank>interactive
dashboard</a> for possible
scenarios.</p><blockquote><p>For comparison: the <a href=https://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/ets_en target=_blank>EU emission trading
system</a> covers about 45% of the
market and sets a reduction rate of 2.2%. In no scenario is 2.2% sufficient.
The reduction rate rather needs to be roughly 10%. No wonder certificates
were not effective so far. We did not set ambitious targets. Why should
we blame certificates for achieving what we asked them to?</p></blockquote><p>After selecting such a scenario one simply has to emit the certificates
calculated by the parameters provided and the market will do the rest.</p><h2 id=summary>Summary</h2><p>Certificates guarantee the most efficient (cheapest) transition to sustainable
energy. They allow us to simply input our desired value and automatically set
incentives for companies to achieve these values. In this sense climate change
is incredibly easy to solve from an economic perspective. The only issue
is political will.</p><h2 id=qa>Q&A</h2><h3 id=what-happens-if-a-company-runs-out-of-certificates>What happens if a company runs out of certificates?</h3><p><strong>Q</strong>: Is is correct, if all certificates for one year are sold, a company
without certificates is not allowed to sell their products? (if they do not
have measures to set CO2-emissions to zero?).</p><p><strong>A</strong>: A company without certificates is a company which did not bid higher,
which means the alternative was cheaper (reducing their CO2 emissions). So
therefore that company would be able to reduce its emissions. But you can
always buy and sell certificates to other companies if you find out later
that you misjudged.</p><h3 id=who-needs-to-buy-certificates>Who needs to buy certificates?</h3><p><strong>Q</strong>: How are the CO2-emissions are calculated? Does the bakery in my
neighborhood need a certificate or only the big energy/oil companies?</p><p><strong>A</strong>: Ideally certificates would cover all CO2 emissions. But in order to avoid
the bureaucracy you can do the following:</p><ul><li>Assume that fossil fuels will eventually be burned, and since the amount of
carbon atoms in these fuels is known and determine the amount of CO2
released, you can sell the certificates together with the fuels at import
time/extraction.</li><li>Consumers who buy the fuel would not have to deal with
certificates because the filling station already bought the certificates with
the gas. And simply sells it to you under the assumption that you are going
to burn the fuel.</li><li>So only companies importing or extracting the fuel would
actually have to deal with certificates.</li><li>Caveat: If you are a power plant and use carbon capture, then you bought
fuel with certificates, but since you captured the CO2, you did not actually
release the CO2 as assumed at the beginning. So in this case (if you prove
that you captured the CO2), you can resell the certificate. (In this sense it
is quite similar to &ldquo;pre-tax&rdquo;)</li></ul></div></article><div class=post-comment data-comment=utterances><span class=post-comment-notloaded><i class="iconfont icon-chatbox-ellipses-sharp"></i>&nbsp;Load comments</span>
