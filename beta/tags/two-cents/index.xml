      <description>&lt;p&gt;Cynical people like to call me naive, whenever I suggest how good or neutral
intentions could have lead to a situation where they suspect malice. But naivety
implies there would be no thought behind assuming best intentions, just lack of
experience. And this is not the case.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Proof Assistants for Typesetting Maths</title>

      <description>I am currently trying make our exercise sheets HTML based to allow for things like drop down solutions, which start in a collapsed state. I ended up asking myself whether it might be possible yet to verify proofs submitted by students automatically. So I looked for Proof Assistants and ended up with lean. In particular I tried out the Natural Numbers Game and started reading Theorem Proving in Lean for a more comprehensive introduction.
Landmark based Maths vs Steps in Proof Assistants The first contrast I noticed was the following. When you write down Maths for another human, you tend to write something like:</description>

      <title>Smart Quotas</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;While equal rights could be viewed as an issue of the past (at least in most
developed countries), equal opportunity is still an open issue. In a free
market wages and hiring decisions are not up to the law and thus equal rights
are not enough to guarantee equal opportunity. While wages for equal work can
be achieved with transparency and public pressure, it is much more difficult to
quantify hiring discrimination. For this reason many people argue for a quota
to actually affect these decisions with written law, so that injustices could
be tried in court.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A Recipe for Endless War</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On sunday the game of the &amp;ldquo;Hooligan Eagles&amp;rdquo; against the &amp;ldquo;LesserEvil Hawks&amp;rdquo;
is taking place. The city decided, in order to protect the police, it
will not send in police to enforce a peaceful game. Instead, it intends to
supply the fans of the &amp;ldquo;LesserEvil Hawks&amp;rdquo; with handguns so they can protect
themselves against the often violent fans of the &amp;ldquo;Hooligan Eagles&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the referee takes one of the Hooligan Eagles players off the field for a
foul, the camera pans to an increasingly rowdy crowd of Eagle fans close to
the Hawks fan section.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A Better Education System</title>
      <link>https://www.unassuming.page/blog/two-cents/better_education/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Education is one of those topics, which everyone has an opinion on, and reforms
are proposed every other day. In Germany it is even worse, as education is state&amp;rsquo;s
jurisdiction, so multiply the mess by 16. So, is this just another
proposal which claims to be much better than any others proposed before?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>There are only two colors</title>
      <link>https://www.unassuming.page/blog/two-cents/there-are-only-two-colors/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;a lot of people would protest. There are of course more than two colors. For
example &amp;ldquo;red, green, blue&amp;rdquo; are already three. Okay so maybe the statement was
an exaggeration. How about &amp;ldquo;only 5 colors&amp;rdquo; (Red, Yellow, Green, Blue,
Violet)? Some people might start to agree with that statement. Other people
might list a few more. At some point words for more colors will run out. Yet
some people would still disagree with the statement: &amp;ldquo;there are only x
colors&amp;rdquo;. Even though we only have a finite number of words for them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It seems fitting that the first article of a blog should layout the foundation
of my beliefs. So&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
