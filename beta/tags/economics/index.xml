      <description>&lt;p&gt;If housing supply stays constant and there is more demand for housing than
available, then prioritization is necessary. Allocation priority is often
assigned either by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;q&gt;willingness to pay&lt;/q&gt; induced by a market economy,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;or &lt;q&gt;first come, first serve&lt;/q&gt; induced by rent caps.&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Livable Cities vs. Cars</title>
      <link>https://www.unassuming.page/blog/economics/livable-cities-vs-cars/</link>

      <description>Cars take tons of space
While bike paths and especially public transport have significantly more throughput,
 more space is allocated to cars.
This is fundamentally unfair.
And this does not even account for the stupendous amount of space cars occupy while parked.
Why do people move to the suburbs? They want to escape cars. Well, they are going to say they want to escape the noise and have easy access to nature. But cities are not loud, cars are. Here is a video of someone taking noise measurements
 and if we removed two car lanes and all parking, we could add tons of greenery to every street.</description>

      <title>Microeconomics 101</title>

      <description>    The following introduction to microeconomics is how I think introductory lectures should be structured. In particular we are going to avoid taking money for granted and try to arrive at money as a result rather than use it as an axiom. The justification for this is sometimes tacked on later using Edgeworth boxes. But these assume fixed endowments. Even General Equilibrium Theory unnecessarily assumes there are consumers and firms    Exchange Rate (Good 2 : Good 1) : Price Angle         </description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Everyone has preferences. In some sense it defines what being alive means and
I tend to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.unassuming.page/blog/two-cents/concise_philosophy/&#34;&gt;view preferences as axioms&lt;/a&gt;.
They are also treated as axioms in economics. But what are preferences?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Utility Everyone has preferences. In some sense it defines what being alive means and I tend to view preferences as axioms. They are also treated as axioms in economics. But what are preferences?
Formally preferences are a binary relation on the set of possible world states. The greater or equal symbol &amp;ldquo;≥&amp;rdquo; is such a binary relation for example and a good intuition for what we are getting at. We then make certain assumptions about this relation:
  First of all we assume connexity (also called &amp;ldquo;completeness&amp;rdquo;). This just means that we can compare any two world states, which means that for any two world states A and B, we either &amp;ldquo;weakly prefer A over B&amp;rdquo; (A ≿ B) or we &amp;ldquo;weakly prefer B over A&amp;rdquo; or both.</description>

      <title>Fixed Costs are Increasing</title>
      <link>https://www.unassuming.page/blog/economics/fixedcost/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I claim that every innovation in human history has decreased the share of
variable costs and increased the share of fixed costs. In support of this claim,
take a random sample of technologies, e.g. the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_technologies&amp;amp;oldid=984777058&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;list of practical
technologies on
wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Economic Impact of Climate Neutrality</title>

      <guid>https://www.unassuming.page/blog/economics/econ_impact_of_carbon_neutrality/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;How much does it cost to become Carbon Neutral? Is it feasible? Or is it too
radical? I think that many people paint a grimmer picture than necessary. In
fact I would go so far as to say we can solve climate change in our lunch
break. Let me explain&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Why Certificates are the Right Tool for Limiting CO2 Emission</title>
      <link>https://www.unassuming.page/blog/economics/why_certificates/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;First of all: A tax and certificate system is equivalent to some degree. The
main difference is that taxes set prices while certificates set quantities.
But more on that later. And since taxes are easier to understand I will start
with explaining them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Why Communism is not discussed in Economics</title>
      <link>https://www.unassuming.page/blog/economics/communism/</link>

      <guid>https://www.unassuming.page/blog/economics/communism/</guid>
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Communism is not a bad economic system. It is not an economic system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every economic system is fundamentally an allocation algorithm. Somehow it
must be decided what is produced, and who can use/consume that. An economic
system is the “recipe” (algorithm) for making this decision. If you specify
such an algorithm, you can make statements about the result.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
