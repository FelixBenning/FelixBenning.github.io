      <description>&lt;p&gt;If housing supply stays constant and there is more demand for housing than
available, then prioritization is necessary. Allocation priority is often
assigned either by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;q&gt;willingness to pay&lt;/q&gt; induced by a market economy,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;or &lt;q&gt;first come, first serve&lt;/q&gt; induced by rent caps.&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Livable Cities vs. Cars</title>
      <link>https://www.unassuming.page/blog/economics/livable-cities-vs-cars/</link>

      <description>Cars take tons of space
While bike paths and especially public transport have significantly more throughput,
 more space is allocated to cars.
This is fundamentally unfair.
And this does not even account for the stupendous amount of space cars occupy while parked.
Why do people move to the suburbs? They want to escape cars. Well, they are going to say they want to escape the noise and have easy access to nature. But cities are not loud, cars are. Here is a video of someone taking noise measurements
 and if we removed two car lanes and all parking, we could add tons of greenery to every street.</description>

      <title>Version Control with Git</title>
      <link>https://www.unassuming.page/blog/programming/git/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When choosing a programming language or database, there are so many options to
choose from. And people regularly create new options since they are not happy
with the existing ones. But for version control, there exists essentially just
one option: &lt;code&gt;Git&lt;/code&gt;. And while it takes some getting used to, it must do something
right, if nobody wants to spend the effort to improve upon it. This is a
small introduction.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Cynical people like to call me naive, whenever I suggest how good or neutral
intentions could have lead to a situation where they suspect malice. But naivety
implies there would be no thought behind assuming best intentions, just lack of
experience. And this is not the case.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Microeconomics 101</title>

      <description>    The following introduction to microeconomics is how I think introductory lectures should be structured. In particular we are going to avoid taking money for granted and try to arrive at money as a result rather than use it as an axiom. The justification for this is sometimes tacked on later using Edgeworth boxes. But these assume fixed endowments. Even General Equilibrium Theory unnecessarily assumes there are consumers and firms    Exchange Rate (Good 2 : Good 1) : Price Angle         </description>

      <title>Programming in Lean</title>

      <guid>https://www.unassuming.page/blog/programming/programming-in-lean/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Lean is quite a bit different from other programming languages. People familiar
with Haskell (or other functional programming languages) might be a bit more
comfortable  from the get go, but if you do not have that background there are
a couple of stumbling blocks you might encounter. So I thought I would point
out some of the gotchas I sumbled over learning this.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>I am currently trying make our exercise sheets HTML based to allow for things like drop down solutions, which start in a collapsed state. I ended up asking myself whether it might be possible yet to verify proofs submitted by students automatically. So I looked for Proof Assistants and ended up with lean. In particular I tried out the Natural Numbers Game and started reading Theorem Proving in Lean for a more comprehensive introduction.
Landmark based Maths vs Steps in Proof Assistants The first contrast I noticed was the following. When you write down Maths for another human, you tend to write something like:</description>

If you use a test with 95% sensitivity and 95% specificity, and it is positive
then you are surly more likely sick than not, right? Well, ... it depends.
On the prior probability to be sick (or prevalence) to be precise. And
humans are really bad assessing the meaning of a test result.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Probability theory is best understood through the lense of &amp;ldquo;the &lt;strong&gt;expected
value&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo;. We are fundamentally trying to understand what we can expect so
the expected value is a great place to start&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Everyone has preferences. In some sense it defines what being alive means and
I tend to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.unassuming.page/blog/two-cents/concise_philosophy/&#34;&gt;view preferences as axioms&lt;/a&gt;.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;While equal rights could be viewed as an issue of the past (at least in most
developed countries), equal opportunity is still an open issue. In a free
market wages and hiring decisions are not up to the law and thus equal rights
are not enough to guarantee equal opportunity. While wages for equal work can
be achieved with transparency and public pressure, it is much more difficult to
quantify hiring discrimination. For this reason many people argue for a quota
to actually affect these decisions with written law, so that injustices could
be tried in court.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Utility Everyone has preferences. In some sense it defines what being alive means and I tend to view preferences as axioms. They are also treated as axioms in economics. But what are preferences?
Formally preferences are a binary relation on the set of possible world states. The greater or equal symbol &amp;ldquo;≥&amp;rdquo; is such a binary relation for example and a good intuition for what we are getting at. We then make certain assumptions about this relation:
  First of all we assume connexity (also called &amp;ldquo;completeness&amp;rdquo;). This just means that we can compare any two world states, which means that for any two world states A and B, we either &amp;ldquo;weakly prefer A over B&amp;rdquo; (A ≿ B) or we &amp;ldquo;weakly prefer B over A&amp;rdquo; or both.</description>

variable costs and increased the share of fixed costs. In support of this claim,
take a random sample of technologies, e.g. the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_technologies&amp;amp;oldid=984777058&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;list of practical

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On sunday the game of the &amp;ldquo;Hooligan Eagles&amp;rdquo; against the &amp;ldquo;LesserEvil Hawks&amp;rdquo;
is taking place. The city decided, in order to protect the police, it
will not send in police to enforce a peaceful game. Instead, it intends to
supply the fans of the &amp;ldquo;LesserEvil Hawks&amp;rdquo; with handguns so they can protect
themselves against the often violent fans of the &amp;ldquo;Hooligan Eagles&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the referee takes one of the Hooligan Eagles players off the field for a
foul, the camera pans to an increasingly rowdy crowd of Eagle fans close to
the Hawks fan section.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

are proposed every other day. In Germany it is even worse, as education is state&amp;rsquo;s

main difference is that taxes set prices while certificates set quantities.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;a lot of people would protest. There are of course more than two colors. For
example &amp;ldquo;red, green, blue&amp;rdquo; are already three. Okay so maybe the statement was
an exaggeration. How about &amp;ldquo;only 5 colors&amp;rdquo; (Red, Yellow, Green, Blue,
Violet)? Some people might start to agree with that statement. Other people
might list a few more. At some point words for more colors will run out. Yet
some people would still disagree with the statement: &amp;ldquo;there are only x
colors&amp;rdquo;. Even though we only have a finite number of words for them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Communism is not a bad economic system. It is not an economic system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every economic system is fundamentally an allocation algorithm. Somehow it
must be decided what is produced, and who can use/consume that. An economic
system is the “recipe” (algorithm) for making this decision. If you specify
such an algorithm, you can make statements about the result.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://www.unassuming.page/blog/programming/intuitive-indexing/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;While most programming languages use 0-based indexing &lt;a href=&#34;https://hisham.hm/2021/01/18/again-on-0-based-vs-1-based-indexing/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;some people are not
convinced&lt;/a&gt; that this is a good thing and not just the legacy of
the language C. They argue that starting to index with one is more &lt;em&gt;intuitive&lt;/em&gt;
than starting to index with zero, and that there is no good reason to use
0-based indices besides pointer arithmetic which should not be of concern to
higher level programming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And to be fair, proponents of zero based indexing have mostly failed to provide
a convincing argument for their preference (&lt;a href=&#34;#5-ranges&#34;&gt;Dijkstra&amp;rsquo;s range
argument&lt;/a&gt; aside). To remedy this, I am going to present 5 arguments
for 0-based indexing and address the intuition argument of 1-based
indexing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>-- Hi, my name is Felix Benning! I am a developer, mathematician and economist living in Germany.
Well, these are the areas where I am either working professionally, or happen to have an actual degree in. But that hasn&amp;rsquo;t stopped me from writing unsolicited two cents about a wide range of topics I am interested in.
The best summary of my interest might be, that I am fascinated by fixed costs and thus automation. The concept of creating something which will improve peoples lives in perpetuity is just magnificent. I believe that fixed costs
 are the driving force behind all major economic changes in human history cause the explosion in living standards we are currently witnessing drive the increasing cooperation between continents, full of better and better educated people might be the reason we will never have a world war again mean that AI will likely be friendly and unfortunately wreck an economic system which is based on marginal costs and competition.</description>
