You can not reason whether logic makes sense using logic. So I will not even
try. We will see shortly that I find some other things to be impossible.
Being trained in mathematics, I do not find that too unusual. While I think
that my belief system turned out to be remarkable consistent and did not
really encounter any problems in the last few years, I would be stupid to
think I have discovered an absolute truth. But since the contrary is
grammatically unwieldy, I will present my thoughts as such.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Zero vs One-based Indexing</title><link>https://felixbenning.github.io/blog/programming/0_vs_1_based_indexing/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://felixbenning.github.io/blog/programming/0_vs_1_based_indexing/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="it-is-only-about-pointers">&amp;ldquo;It is only about pointers&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Proponents of counting from 1 often think that this is about pointers and
claim that it only makes sense for computer scientist as accessing an element
from an array on hardware translates to addition to the pointer which means
that the first element is at 0. They then like to argue that an index from 1
would make more sense in maths and &amp;ldquo;for counting&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I will try to explain why this is not the case.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>About me</title><link>https://felixbenning.github.io/about/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Oct 2020 19:03:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://felixbenning.github.io/about/</guid><description>-- Hi, my name is Felix Benning! I am a developer, mathematician and economist living in Germany.
Well, these are the areas where I am either working professionally, or happen to have an actual degree in. But that hasn&amp;rsquo;t stopped me from writing unsolicited two cents about a wide range of topics I am interested in.
The best summary of my interest might be, that I am fascinated by fixed costs and thus automation. The concept of creating something which will improve peoples lives in perpetuity is just magnificent. I believe that fixed costs
are the driving force behind all major economic changes in human history cause the explosion in living standards we are currently witnessing drive the increasing cooperation between continents, full of better and better educated people might be the reason we will never have a world war again mean that AI will likely be friendly and unfortunately wreck an economic system which is based on marginal costs and competition.</description></item></channel></rss>
