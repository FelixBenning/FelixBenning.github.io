is taking place. The city decided, in order to protect the police, it
will not send in police to enforce a peaceful game. Instead, it intends to
supply the fans of the &amp;ldquo;LesserEvil Hawks&amp;rdquo; with handguns so they can protect
themselves against the often violent fans of the &amp;ldquo;Hooligan Eagles&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When the referee takes one of the Hooligan Eagles players off the field for a
foul, the camera pans to an increasingly rowdy crowd of Eagle fans close to
the Hawks fan section.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>CO2 Budget Model</title><link>https://felixbenning.github.io/blog/economics/co2_budget_model/</link><pubDate>Sat, 31 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://felixbenning.github.io/blog/economics/co2_budget_model/</guid><description> This is a quick and dirty embedding of an older shiny app you can also access in full size</description></item><item><title>The Economic Impact of Climate Neutrality</title><link>https://felixbenning.github.io/blog/economics/econ_impact_of_carbon_neutrality/</link><pubDate>Sat, 31 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://felixbenning.github.io/blog/economics/econ_impact_of_carbon_neutrality/</guid><description>&lt;p>How much does it cost to become Carbon Neutral? Is it feasible? Or is it too
radical? I think that many people paint a grimmer picture than necessary. In
fact I would go so far as to say we can solve climate change in our lunch

Let me explain&amp;hellip;&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A Better Education System</title><link>https://felixbenning.github.io/blog/two-cents/better_education/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://felixbenning.github.io/blog/two-cents/better_education/</guid><description>&lt;p>Education is one of those topics, which everyone has an opinion on, and reforms
are proposed every other day. In Germany it is even worse, as education is state&amp;rsquo;s
jurisdiction, so multiply the mess by 16. So, is this just another
proposal which claims to be much better than any others proposed before?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Why Certificates are the Right Tool for Limiting CO2 Emission</title><link>https://felixbenning.github.io/blog/economics/why_certificates/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://felixbenning.github.io/blog/economics/why_certificates/</guid><description>&lt;p>First of all: A tax and certificate system is equivalent to some degree. The
main difference is that taxes set prices while certificates set quantities.
But more on that later. And since taxes are easier to understand I will start
with explaining them.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>There are only two colors</title><link>https://felixbenning.github.io/blog/two-cents/there-are-only-two-colors/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://felixbenning.github.io/blog/two-cents/there-are-only-two-colors/</guid><description>&lt;p>a lot of people would protest. There are of course more than two colors. For
example &amp;ldquo;red, green, blue&amp;rdquo; are already three. Okay so maybe the statement was
an exaggeration. How about &amp;ldquo;only 5 colors&amp;rdquo; (Red, Yellow, Green, Blue,
Violet)? Some people might start to agree with that statement. Other people
might list a few more. At some point words for more colors will run out. Yet
some people would still disagree with the statement: &amp;ldquo;there are only x
colors&amp;rdquo;. Even though we only have a finite number of words for them.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Why Communism is not discussed in Economics</title><link>https://felixbenning.github.io/blog/economics/communism/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://felixbenning.github.io/blog/economics/communism/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Communism is not a bad economic system. It is not an economic system.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Every economic system is fundamentally an allocation algorithm. Somehow it
must be decided what is produced, and who can use/consume that. An economic
system is the “recipe” (algorithm) for making this decision. If you specify
such an algorithm, you can make statements about the result.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Concise Philosophy</title><link>https://felixbenning.github.io/blog/two-cents/concise_philosophy/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://felixbenning.github.io/blog/two-cents/concise_philosophy/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="what-is">What is?&lt;/h2>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I think, therefore I am - &lt;em>Descartes&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>We can be sure that something exists which does the thinking. You might
now argue that abstract things like language and mathematics exist. Since a
version of them can be part of your consciousness, which exists. But beyond
that nothing concrete needs to exist, as thought experiments like &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_in_a_vat" target="_blank">Brain in a
vat&lt;/a> or &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann_brain" target="_blank">Boltzmann
Brains&lt;/a>
prove (as they are not falsifiable you can not prove you are &lt;em>not&lt;/em> one
of those, so therefore you can not prove that anything concrete &lt;em>must&lt;/em> exist).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Zero vs One-based Indexing</title><link>https://felixbenning.github.io/blog/programming/0_vs_1_based_indexing/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://felixbenning.github.io/blog/programming/0_vs_1_based_indexing/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="it-is-only-about-pointers">&amp;ldquo;It is only about pointers&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Proponents of counting from 1 often think that this is about pointers and
claim that it only makes sense for computer scientist as accessing an element
from an array on hardware translates to addition to the pointer which means
that the first element is at 0. They then like to argue that an index from 1
would make more sense in maths and &amp;ldquo;for counting&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I will try to explain why this is not the case.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>About me</title><link>https://felixbenning.github.io/about/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Oct 2020 19:03:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://felixbenning.github.io/about/</guid><description>-- Hi, my name is Felix Benning! I am a developer, mathematician and economist living in Germany.
Well, these are the areas where I am either working professionally, or happen to have an actual degree in. But that hasn&amp;rsquo;t stopped me from writing unsolicited two cents about a wide range of topics I am interested in.
The best summary of my interest might be, that I am fascinated by fixed costs and thus automation. The concept of creating something which will improve peoples lives in perpetuity is just magnificent. I believe that fixed costs
are the driving force behind all major economic changes in human history cause the explosion in living standards we are currently witnessing drive the increasing cooperation between continents, full of better and better educated people might be the reason we will never have a world war again mean that AI will likely be friendly and unfortunately wreck an economic system which is based on marginal costs and competition.</description></item></channel></rss>
